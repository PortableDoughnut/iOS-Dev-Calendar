## Overview

An often overlooked part of app development is the process of adding in localization and accessibility features. Apple has several recommendations for how to implement these features in the [Human Interface Guidelines.](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/accessibility) Take the time to read through those recommendations so you are more familiar with all of them prior to beginning work on the specific ones you are concerned with here.

## Objectives

- Practice using some of the features of Swift that allow more people to access your app

## Minimum Tasks: 

- [ ] Follow the Human Interface Guidelines steps to making the app accessible to users working with VoiceOver. "VoiceOver is a screen reader that lets people experience your appâ€™s interface without needing to see the screen. For guidance, see [VoiceOver.](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/voiceover)" -The Human Interface Guidelines

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Adds VoiceOver to support to views wherever possible.
- [ ] No major bugs or issues when testing.
