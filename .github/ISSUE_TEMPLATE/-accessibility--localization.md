## Overview

An often overlooked part of app development is the process of adding in localization and accessibility features. Apple has several recommendations for how to implement these features in the [Human Interface Guidelines.](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/accessibility) Take the time to read through those recommendations so you are more familiar with all of them prior to beginning work on the specific ones you are concerned with here.

## Objectives

- Practice using some of the features of Swift that allow more people to access your app

## Minimum Tasks: 

- [ ] Follow the [Apple Developer Documentation's instructions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode/localization/) on localization.
  - While localization generally includes making sure that your currency, screen layout, and so on are fully localized, for this app we are primarily concerned with building a [string catalog](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/localizing-and-varying-text-with-a-string-catalog). You should still be familiar with the other localization concerns discussed in the documentation, and can implement any others you would like to practice with.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ]
