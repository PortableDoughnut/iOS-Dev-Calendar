## Overview

- The layout and design of views for this app were intentionally left in an incomplete state, allowing you the chance to revise as you see fit. For time management reasons, your focus should be on improving existing designs, adding minor updates that will improve the appearance without needing a complete overhaul.

- With your group and an instructor, review each of your assigned Views and discuss how they could be improved. We don't want you spending more than one full-time workday (8 hours) on this, so prioritize the changes that will give the greatest return on your time investment.

## Objectives

- Demonstrate ability to modify UIKit Storyboards and UIViewControllers to improve styling

## Assigned Files

## Notes

- This is not a class on design, so you won't be scored on how well you improved the visual design and layout, just that you made concrete changes decided on by your group.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Submitted PR logs several changes to the base designs, settled on by the group
- [ ] Design changes do not impede functionality of the app
